# Bittensor Subnets

> *This report was compiled by [@igorsyl](https://x.com/igorsyl). I fetched the GitHub repository URLs for each Bittensor subnet, downloaded the latest default branch, and used Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash to analyze the codebases. The model was prompted to explain the incentivized task, validation, and mining mechanics for each subnet. Data is current as of April 23, 2025.  
>  
> The motivation behind this project was to explore the depth, breadth, and diversity of incentivized compute within the Bittensor ecosystem, and to inspire the creation of new subnets by showcasing existing approaches to incentive design and validation.*
